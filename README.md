learnyounode solutions
======================

These are solutions to the learnyounode workshopper. They are written by
[@TimothyGu](https://github.org/TimothyGu) on his endeavour to Node.js
mastery. It is meant to help Node.js beginners for the PIxEL Clubs (and
myself). Not guaranteed to be safe for production (i.e. multi-core servers,
VHS, etc.) use!

Contributing

ALL contributions that make the code easier to read or more robust against are
welcome, as long as it doesn't make the code harder to read for a Node.js
beginner (like me).
